Hello!

This is Pradip.  I am interested in transforming data into meaningful insights.
Data is everywhere and every place has it whether its on land, space, or under water.
Your every project (at work or home) uses data in small and big ways.
Data Analytics is not just for paid professional Data Scientists.  It can be for anyone with interest in data; in fact you speak data everyday.  The question "are we there yet?" from the backseat, is a question about data :)

Thanks for reading,

Pradip
